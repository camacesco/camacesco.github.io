I am **Francesco Camaglia**, currently a PhD Candidate in theoretical biophysics at Laboiratoire de Physique de l'École Normale Supérieure in Paris, in the group of Thierry Mora and Aleksandra Walczak ([website](https://sites.google.com/view/statbiophysens/home?authuser=0)).

I apply techniques from statistical mechanics and data science to study the adaptive immune system and its development.
