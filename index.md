I am **Francesco Camaglia**, currently a postdoc at Institut Pasteur in Paris in the group Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases of Simon Cauchemez ([website]([https://sites.google.com/view/statbiophysens/home?authuser=0](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/mathematical-modelling-of-infectious-diseases/))).

I apply techniques from statistical physics and data science to study the infectuos diseases and the adaptive immune system. 

You can also find me on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EpPP7K8AAAAJ&hl=it&authuser=1&oi=ao) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-camaglia-812567207).
